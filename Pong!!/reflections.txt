GAMEPLAY
To play pong there are 2 players, or a player and an ai, which they can move up and down. There is a 
ball/orb/sprite that moves back and forth between the two players "hit boxes" or rectangles. When it hits either
a top or bottom wall or a player it will bounce off, if it hits a horizontal wall/a player's wall the ball will 
dissapear and the other player is the winner (ball did not hit their wall).

The game begins when a player hits the 'enter' key, the ball starts in the middle and will move to the left until 
it hits a player or a player's wall

The game ends when the ball hits a player's wall 11 times overall, the left player and right player has a
different point counter (left player earns point when ball goes into right wall, needs to hit 11 points to win)

if ball hits right wall it appears in the middle again and begins to move to the left, as well as adding a point
to left player's counter (and vice versa)
if the ball hits a top wall or player's hit box it will bounce off 
if either player hits 11 points the game ends
